#summary
This is an academic project where I used object-oriented programming to simulate stochastic models.
In particular, I modeled the proliferation of virus replicating in a patient's body.
In addition, I modeled the introduction of a drug to the body of the patient, and graphed using pylab
the effects of the drug on the virus over time (population-time graph).
